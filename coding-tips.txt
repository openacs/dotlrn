Templating
----------

- You CANNOT nest the <multiple> tag in a single template. Use the <include>
  tag instead. Pass in the necessary vars. Somebody made a patch to 
  nest multiples, but it's not in the tree yet (as of 2/16/02).

- in <include> tags, you can pass a datasource (i.e. a <multiple>) using the
  "&=" notation. E.g. from /new-portal/www/place-element.adp

    <include src=place-element-other-page &="element_multi" 
             target_stub=@target_stub@
             portal_id=@portal_id@
             page_id=@element_multi.page_id@>
  
PL/SQL
------

- You can't have a package with the same name as a table! If you do this
  you get "ORA-00955: name is already used by an existing object" errors

- Always use fully qualified argument names in procs and funcs:

  e.g. in a func named "new" with args "package_id" and "content"

        insert into static_portal_content
        (package_id, content)
        values
        (new.package_id, new.content);
