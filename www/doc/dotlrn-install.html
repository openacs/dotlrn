       Read the extensive OpenACS installation
       <a href="http://openacs.org/doc/openacs-4">documentation</a>.
       Do not download OpenACS 4, however; download the latest dotLRN
       distribution from the
       <a href="http://openacs.org/projects/dotlrn/download</a>
       dotLRN repository</a>.   The distribution includes all OpenACS
       4 packages needed to install and run dotLRN.

       After downloading the dotLRN distribution, follow the OpenACS
       4 installation instructions.  dotLRN is automatically installed
       and configured as part of the installation process if you install
       using a standard dotLRN distribution.

       When installation complete, restart AOLserver as described in
       the OpenACS installation instructions.  You'll need to wait a 
       few minutes while dotLRN configures itself.  Reload your
       browser page.  If installation was successful, you'll see a
       login page.  Use the user name and password you entered for
       the system administrator.  A page will come up that includes
       a link to sitewide administration.  Visit the link, then click
       on the "users" link and then approve the system administrator's
       dotLRN membership.  

  <p class="heading">Explore dotLRN</p>

  <p class="indent">

      Go to dotLRN Administration at
      <tt>http://yourserver/dotlrn/admin</tt>.  Make some dotLRN
      users, terms, departments, classes.
