# This page was modified to allow more that one user to be dropped at a time.
# This one done so there is one consistent way of dropping members.
#
# The parameter "user_id" was kept so that other entry points (both current
# and those that might occur in the future from OpenACS and other changes)
# wouldn't break.  This does have the unfortunate consequence that the name
# user_id is not intuitive when it is a list of many user_ids. (teadams@alum.mit.edu)
